# Mariam-s-Assignment3-Password-Generator

In this assignment, It's the password generator using java scrip. We got given the code for the index.html, style.css, and script.js which is the javascript part. The problem I needed to solve is to fix the website using javascript therefore the website can give the user a generated random password. To do that we had to use a characters array which helps give options for our website to generate the password. Also using javascript I managed to prompt the user to choose a password length between 8-128 characters and for it to also confirm to have numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters in their random password. By doing that we add a variable declaration for it to link to when the user is confirming what characters they want on their random password. 

What did I learn? 
Using the skills I learned in javascript, I applied my skills when creating a website for a user to manage to get a random password. I used a prompt in javascript and an array to make the website generate a random password for the user.
